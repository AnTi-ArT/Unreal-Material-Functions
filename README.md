# Unreal-Material-Functions
My collection of material functions for Unreal Engine.

## Installation
Copy the folder AnTi_MaterialFunction into your project's Content folder. You can rename/move stuff around after Unreal scanned the files.

## Reference
https://github.com/AnTi-ArT/Unreal-Material-Functions/wiki
The Wiki has images, Node previews and examples for (some) of the functions.


Post Process Materials the use some of the material functions.
